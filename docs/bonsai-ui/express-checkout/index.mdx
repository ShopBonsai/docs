## Description

Bonsai Express Checkout is a service that allows customers to quickly and easily purchase a single product with configurable quantities through the company's custom user interface.

To use the Express Checkout service, customers simply need to navigate to Express Checkout URL and select the desired quantity.

The Express Checkout service requires that the `productId` and `variantId` of the product being purchased be passed as query parameters in the URL. These parameters are used to identify the specific product and variant that the customer is purchasing.

:::info
Your `API key` will be shared with you by your account manager.

## Example

_Fill in the required fields to generate Express Checkout URL._

import { ExpressCheckoutUrl } from '@site/src/components/ExpressUrl';

<ExpressCheckoutUrl />

:::info
We support 3 optional callbacks that can be defined, and exposed to the `window` object. If they are defined in the URL, Express Checkout will invoke them at appropriate times.

1. `onSuccess` - called with the `order` details object on a successful checkout
2. `onError` - called when a payment error occurs
3. `onClose` - called if the checkout is closing, usually due to some error when initializing (e.g. missing a variant id in the URL)

#### Example

```js
window.myOnSuccess = (order) => {
  /* do something with order */
};
```

Given a URL that contains a query param `&onSuccess=myOnSuccess`, Express checkout will invoke this function with order details
:::

Generated Express Checkout URL can be used to link from the product page's CTA directly to Express Checkout. The customer will be redirected to the checkout page, where they can enter their payment and shipping information and complete their purchase.

Overall, the Express Checkout service is a convenient and efficient way for customers to purchase a single product from Bonsai, and is an important part of the Bonsai e-commerce offering.
