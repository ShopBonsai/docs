This document explains how to use the Bonsai Checkout, and guides you through the process of
integrating it with your website.

# Integrations

There are 2 ways to integrate with Bonsai Checkout:

1. `Embedded` - embedding the Bonsai Checkout in your website
2. `Hosted` - redirecting to secure Bonsai Checkout URL

Each one of these integrations has its own advantages and disadvantages, and you should choose the one that fits your needs.

## Embedded

This integration enables you to run checkout process on your domain.
This is the recommended way to integrate.

You can obtain `order` information after a successful checkout or an `error` in case of a failure through _callbacks_, explained in the following sections.

### Query parameters

`Checkout` app reads the following query parameters from the URL:

| Name        | Value           | Description                                                  | Required |
| :---------- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `bonsai`    | `checkout_ID`   | Starts checkout process using provided cart ID               | Yes      |
| `onSuccess` | `yourSuccessFn` | A _name_ of callback function that will be called on success | No       |
| `onError`   | `yourErrorFn`   | A _name_ of callback function that will be called on error   | No       |

:::info Example
https://your.domain.com/checkout?bonsai=checkout_abcdef

https://your.domain.com/checkout?bonsai=checkout_abcdef&onSuccess=yourSuccessFn&onError=yourErrorFn
:::

`bonsai` parameter is the only required parameter, and it should be provided with a `cart id` that you want to checkout.

### Callbacks

Callbacks are optional, and you can use them to obtain `order` information after a successful checkout, or an `error` in case of a failure.
These function must be assigned to `window` object, and they will be called with `order` or `error` object as their first argument.

:::info Example

```javascript
window.yourSuccessFn = function (order) {
  // do something with order
};

window.yourErrorFn = function (error) {
  // do something with error
};
```

:::

:::caution
It's important that the names of the callback functions match the names provided in the `onSuccess` and `onError` query parameters.

### Step 1: Create a page

You will need to create a page on your website that will host the Bonsai Checkout,
e.g. `https://your.domain.com/checkout`. We will refer to this page as the `Checkout page`.

### Step 2: Add Bonsai Checkout dependencies

Add the Bonsai Checkout dependencies to `Checkout page`:

```html title="checkout.html"
<head>
  <!-- Bonsai Checkout CSS -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ui.getbonsai.com/index.css" />
</head>

<body>
  <!-- Bonsai Checkout JS -->
  <script data-bonsai-partner-id="YOUR_API_KEY" src="https://ui.getbonsai.com/index.js"></script>
</body>
```

### Step 3: Create cart

In order to start the checkout process, you need to create a cart first.
You can do this by using `Bonsai Carts API`

```bash
curl 'https://carts.shopbonsai.ca/submit' \
  -H 'authority: carts.shopbonsai.ca' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'accept-language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \
  -H 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'pragma: no-cache' \
  --data-raw '{"products":[{"id":"cjzyvxtm407z4rns56tif8job","variantId":"36619342857","quantity":1}]}' \
  --compressed

# result:
# {"data":{"id":"RANDOM_CART_ID"}}
```

:::info
You can find more information about how to create and update carts using the `Bonsai Carts API` [here](/docs/api/carts).
:::

### Step 4: Redirect to checkout

After you have created a cart, and obtained a `cart id`, you can redirect the user to the `Checkout page`.

You will need to add a `bonsai` query parameter to the `Checkout page` URL, with the `cart id` as its value.

:::info Example
https://your.domain.com/checkout?bonsai=checkout_ID
