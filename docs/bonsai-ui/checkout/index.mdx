This document explains how to use the Bonsai Checkout, and guides you through the process of
integrating it with your website.

# Integrations

There are 2 ways to integrate with Bonsai Checkout:

1. `Embedded` - embedding the Bonsai Checkout in your website
2. `Hosted` - redirecting to a secure Bonsai Checkout URL

Based on your preferred experience, choose the one that fits your needs.

## Embedded

This integration enables you to run the checkout process on your domain.

You can obtain the `order` information after a successful checkout through _callbacks_, explained in the following sections.

### Query parameters

`Checkout` app reads the following query parameters from the URL:

| Name        | Value           | Description                                                  | Required |
| :---------- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `bonsai`    | `checkout_ID`   | Starts checkout process using provided cart ID               | Yes      |
| `onSuccess` | `yourSuccessFn` | A _name_ of callback function that will be called on success | No       |

:::info Example
https://your.domain.com/checkout?bonsai=checkout_abcdef

https://your.domain.com/checkout?bonsai=checkout_abcdef&onSuccess=yourSuccessFn
:::

`bonsai` parameter is the only required parameter, and it should be provided with a `cart id` that you want to check out.

### Callbacks

Callbacks are optional, and you can use them to obtain `order` information after a successful checkout, or an `error` in case of a failure.
These functions must be assigned to `window` object and called with `order` or `error` object as their first argument.

:::info Example

```javascript
window.yourSuccessFn = function (order) {
  // do something with order
};
```

:::

:::caution
The success callback function name must match the provided one in the `onSuccess` query parameter.

### Step 1: Create a page

You will need to create a page on your website that will host the Bonsai Checkout,
e.g. `https://your.domain.com/checkout`. We will refer to this page as the `Checkout page`.

### Step 2: Add Bonsai Checkout dependencies

Add the Bonsai Checkout dependencies to `Checkout page`:

```html title="checkout.html"
<head>
  <!-- Bonsai Checkout CSS -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ui.getbonsai.com/index.css" />
</head>

<body>
  <!-- Bonsai Checkout JS -->
  <script data-bonsai-partner-id="YOUR_API_KEY" src="https://ui.getbonsai.com/index.js"></script>
</body>
```

### Step 3: Create cart

In order to start the checkout process, you need to create a cart first.
You can do this by using `Bonsai Carts API`

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'https://api.shopbonsai.ca/carts/v1/submit' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'API-Key: <API_KEY_VALUE>' \
--data-raw '{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "clad6pg5z00eu012gfz7hfm92",
      "variantId": "M00679529706740",
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}'

# result:
# {"data":{"id":"RANDOM_CART_ID"}}
```

You can find more information about how to create and update carts using the `Bonsai Carts API` [here](/docs/api/carts/carts-api).
:::

### Step 4: Redirect to checkout

After you have created a cart, and obtained a `cart id`, you can redirect the user to the `Checkout page`.

You will need to add a `bonsai` query parameter to the `Checkout page` URL, with the `cart id` as its value, and optionally the name of success handler.

:::info Example
https://your.domain.com/checkout?bonsai=checkout_ID&onSuccess=mySuccessHandler
