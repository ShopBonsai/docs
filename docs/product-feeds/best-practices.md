# Best Practices

- Automate feed ingestion
- Re-ingest our feeds at least every 24 hours. We recommend ingesting our feeds every 1-2 hours. This will ensure that you have the latest product data. If you're ingesting our feeds every 24 hours, you might miss out on inventory and price changes. We update feeds every 30 minutes.
- Ingest our feeds on the 15th minute of half hour. For example, ingest our feeds at 12:15, 12:45, 1:15, 1:45, etc. This will ensure that you don't download a feed while it's being updated. This might result in incomplete data.
- Reupload images. This is a good practice, as it allows you to control the images on your site, and also allows you to serve images faster.
