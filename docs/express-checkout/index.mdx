## Description

Bonsai Express Checkout is a service that allows customers to quickly and easily purchase a single product with configurable quantities through the company's custom user interface.

To use the Express Checkout service, customers simply need to navigate to Express Checkout URL and select the desired quantity.

The Express Checkout service requires that the `productId` and `variantId` of the product being purchased be passed as query parameters in the URL. These parameters are used to identify the specific product and variant that the customer is purchasing.

## Example

import { ExpressCheckoutUrl } from '@site/src/components/ExpressUrl'

<ExpressCheckoutUrl />




Once the Express Checkout process has been initiated, the customer will be redirected to the checkout page, where they can enter their payment and shipping information and complete their purchase.

Overall, the Express Checkout service is a convenient and efficient way for customers to purchase a single product from Bonsai, and is an important part of the company's e-commerce offering.
