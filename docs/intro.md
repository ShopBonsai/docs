# Getting Started

Let's discover **Bonsai in less than 5 minutes**.

## Product feeds

[Product feeds](/docs/category/product-feeds) are the primary way to get products from Bonsai into your platform. They are updated frequently and contain all the information you need to sell products.

> Find all information about our [product feeds](/docs/category/product-feeds).

## API

The [Bonsai API](/docs/api) is a RESTful API that allows you to get up-to-date product information, generate checkout totals and place orders. It is the most flexible way to integrate with Bonsai.

## Images

Our [image service](/docs/images) allows you to fetch product images in various sizes. You can either use these directly to display them on your website, or reupload them to your own service (_recommended_).
