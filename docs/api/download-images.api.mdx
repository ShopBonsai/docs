Requests that donâ€™t contain these required headers will return a `401 Unauthorized response.`.\n\nThese credentials will be **supplied to you** in a separate document by your **account manager**\n\n# Testing\n\nIn order to test the **end to end flow**, all requests should be toward the staging environment.
