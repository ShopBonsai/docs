# Bonsai API

The Bonsai API is a REST API that allows you to fetch products, calculate cart totals, submit orders,
and fetch order status, including fulfillment details and refunds. This section provides information on
how to use the API.

## Endpoints

The Bonsai API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded
responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes. It supports cross-origin resource sharing, allowing
you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application.

## Versioning

Breaking changes are handled by prefixing URLs with version numbers (ex. `/v2/`). These prefixes ensure
that new features or other improvements do not impact your existing implementation.

As of February 14th, 2023, Bonsai has released net new endpoints with the `/v2/` prefix. These routes
follow new guidelines to make the API more consistent and predictable for you.

Bonsai will continue to support old endpoints and may later port these over to simultaneously be
available in the prefixed versions. Bonsai will announce any deprecated endpoints well in advance
of their removal.

## Authentication

Depending on the endpoint you are using, there are two ways to authenticate your API requests. These are:

- `APIKeyHeader` - For frontend endpoints. Requires `API-Key` header containing your `apiKey`.
- `AuthorizationHeader` - For backend endpoints. Requires `Authorization` header containing your `privateApiKey`.

:::note
Please note that the `apiKey` and `privateApiKey` are distinct.
:::

To identify which authentication to use, see **Authorization**/**Request** details for that endpoint.

:::info
Your API keys will be shared with you by your account manager.

### `APIKeyHeader`

Provide your API key in the URL as a request header whenever you make `APIKeyHeader` API calls:

```bash
curl https://api.shopbonsai.ca/<api_endpoint> -H "API-Key: <API_KEY>"
```

### `AuthorizationHeader`

Provide your private API key as the "username" portion of a Basic Authorization header whenever you make
`AuthorizationHeader` API calls:

```bash
curl https://api.shopbonsai.ca/<api_endpoint> -H "Authorization: Basic <BASE64_PRIVATE_API_KEY>"
```

<details>
  <summary>Additional private API key instructions</summary>
  <div>

To form your `BASE64_PRIVATE_API_KEY`, you need to take your `privateApiKey` and then encoded it into base64.

For example, if your `privateApiKey` is `bonsaigavemethiskey`, then the `Base64EncodedKey` will be
`Ym9uc2FpZ2F2ZW1ldGhpc2tleQ==`. In the context of the request, it would look like this:

```bash
curl https://api.shopbonsai.ca/<api_endpoint> \
-H "Authorization: Basic Ym9uc2FpZ2F2ZW1ldGhpc2tleQ=="
```

  </div>
</details>
