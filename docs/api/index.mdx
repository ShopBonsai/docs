# Bonsai API

Bonsai API allows you to fetch products, calculate cart totals, submit orders, and fetch order status
including fulfillment details and refunds. This section aims to provide information on how to use the
API.

## Endpoints

The Bonsai API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts
JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes.
We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a
client-side web application.

## Versioning

We use versioning for placing orders to ensure that your application will continue to work as we add
new features and improve the API.

As of February 14th 2023, we have released net new endpoints with the `/v2` prefix. This is to
highlight that these routes follow new guidelines that meant to make our API more consistent and
predictable for you.

The old routes will continue to be supported and may later be ported over to also be available under
`/v2`. We will not make breaking changes to the API without first giving you advance notice.

## Authentication

Depending on the endpoint you are using, there are two ways to authenticate your API requests. These are:

- `APIKeyHeader` - For frontend endpoints. Requires `API-Key` header containing your `apiKey`.
- `AuthorizationHeader` - For backend endpoints. Requires `Authorization` header containing your `privateApiKey`.

:::note
Please keep in mind that the `apiKey` and `privateApiKey` are distinct.
:::

To identify which authentication to use, see **Authorization**/**Request** details for the endpoint you are using.

:::info
Your API keys will be shared with you by your account manager.

### `APIKeyHeader`

Provide your API key in the URL as a request header whenever you make `APIKeyHeader` API calls:

```bash
curl https://api.shopbonsai.ca/<api_endpoint> -H "API-Key: <API_KEY>"
```

### `AuthorizationHeader`

Provide your private API key as the "username" portion of a Basic Authorization header whenever you make
`AuthorizationHeader` API calls:

```bash
curl https://api.shopbonsai.ca/<api_endpoint> -H "Authorization: Basic <BASE64_PRIVATE_API_KEY>"
```

<details>
  <summary>Additional private API key instructions</summary>
  <div>

To form your `BASE64_PRIVATE_API_KEY`, you need to take your `privateApiKey` and then encoded it into base64.

For example, if your `privateApiKey` is `bonsaigavemethiskey`, then the `Base64EncodedKey` will be
`Ym9uc2FpZ2F2ZW1ldGhpc2tleQ==`. In the context of the request, it would look like this:

```bash
curl https://api.shopbonsai.ca/<api_endpoint> \
-H "Authorization: Basic Ym9uc2FpZ2F2ZW1ldGhpc2tleQ=="
```

  </div>
</details>
