# Bonsai API

Bonsai API allows you to fetch products, calculate cart totals, and submit orders. This section aims
to provide information on how to use the API.

## Endpoints

The Bonsai API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts
JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes.
We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a
client-side web application.

## Versioning

We use versioning for placing orders to ensure that your application will continue to work as we add
new features and improve the API. However, we do not version the other endpoints at this time. We
will not make breaking changes to the API without first giving you advance notice.

## Authentication

To authenticate your API requests, you need to provide an API key in request headers.

:::info
Your API key will be shared with you by your account manager.
:::

Provide your API key in the URL as a request header whenever you make API calls:

```bash
curl https://api.shopbonsai.ca/<api_endpoint> -H "API-Key: <API_KEY>"
```

:::tip
If you have questions or need assistance, please contact your account manager.
