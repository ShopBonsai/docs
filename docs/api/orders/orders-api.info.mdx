# Orders API

APIs used for interacting with orders.

There are a few types of integration with the Bonsai Order API depending on who owns the payments.

## Bonsai owns the payment

### Native Checkout experience

During the checkout process, the customer is redirected to Bonsai to complete the payment and complete the order processing.

### API integrated checkout experience

The account is creating their own checkout experience but are leveraging our endpoints to collect payments and complete the order processing.
Please contact our team to provide you with all you need to get started.

## Account owns the payment

If the account is owning the payment, they will need to use the payment method `external payment` to submit the order.
Once the order is submitted, our team will fulfill and Bonsai will invoice you later on the order amount based on our agreement.
