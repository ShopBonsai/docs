# Bonsai REST API



Explore Bonsai's API reference documentation.

# Overview

In order for the API to accept your requests, a few headers are required, as well as using the correct content type.

| Domain | Path | Protocol | Environment | Template name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| api.shopbonsai.ca | / | SSL | Production | {BonsaiEndpoint} |

Making requests without SSL is not allowed.

# Authentication

All requests are required to contain the following headers.

| Header | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Type | application/json |
| API-Key |  |

**About authentication**  
Requests are authenticated and authorized by passing along an API Key using HTTP headers. Requests that donâ€™t contain these required headers will return a `401 Unauthorized response.`.

These credentials will be **supplied to you** in a separate document by your **account manager**

# Testing

In order to test the **end to end flow**, all requests should be toward the staging environment. You can use [Stripe test tokens](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#testing-interactively) to test the different cases.

Please contact your account manager to provide you with:

- Test Stripe API public key
- An API key
- A Product Partner Feed
    

Please let your account manager know about the testing as we actively update our API, and that might impact your testing. We are working on keeping our API backwards-compatible at all times but do not have versioning enabled yet.

# Content-Type

All request bodies are required to be valid JSON. The API does not accept other formats.

# Rate limiting

No information at the moment.
